# clone-amazon
This project is a static webpage designed to mimic the layout and some functionalities of the Amazon India homepage. It's built using HTML for structure and likely CSS for styling, with a basic JavaScript file linked for potential interactive elements.

Key features include:

Navigation Bar: A comprehensive header with an Amazon logo, delivery address (set to India), a search bar with category selection, links for account management and returns/orders, and a shopping cart icon.
Panel/Secondary Navigation: Below the main navigation, a panel provides links to "today's deal," "customer service," "amazon pay," and "sell," along with a prominent "shop deals in electronics" link.
Hero Section: A prominent banner message informs users they are on amazon.com but can shop on Amazon India.
Product/Category Sections: The page features two main "shop sections" with four boxes each, showcasing different product categories like "get your game on," "gift your near ones," "new fashion hub," "toys at least price," "best seller in books," "get best home decor," "get luxury at price," and "elevate your electronics." Each box includes a "shop now" prompt.
Footer: A simple footer with copyright information.
This project serves as a good example of front-end web development, demonstrating HTML structure, the integration of external CSS (Font Awesome), and potentially basic JavaScript for enhanced user experience.
